RippleNet originally began as a money transfer platfrom developed by Ryan Fugger in 2004, it was known as RipplePay. After the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto and David Schwartz decided to create a more consesnsus algorithm that did not consume as much electricity as Bitcoin. In 2012, three years after Bitcoin was introduced, XRP was launched. 100 billion tokens were created with 80 billion goint to the company and 20 billion to the co-founders. XRP is the currency RippleNet uses to facilitate quick conversions between different currencies. In 2013 RipplePay decided to rebrand and OpenCoin was born and set out to revolutionalize the Global Financial system. OpenCoin created a ledger-based payment network for financial institutions using Ripplepay source code. In order for the company to grow and keep inovating they went through multiple rounds of funding including Seed, Angel and series A,B and C to raise $293.9M.
