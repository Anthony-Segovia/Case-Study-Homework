RippleNet originally began as a money transfer platfrom developed by Ryan Fugger in 2004, it was known as RipplePay. After the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto and David Schwartz decided to create a more consesnsus algorithm that did not consume as much electricity as Bitcoin. In 2012, three years after Bitcoin was introduced, XRP was launched. 100 billion tokens were created with 80 billion goint to the company and 20 billion to the co-founders. XRP is the currency RippleNet uses to facilitate quick conversions between different currencies. In 2013 RipplePay decided to rebrand and OpenCoin was born and set out to revolutionalize the Global Financial system. OpenCoin created a ledger-based payment network for financial institutions using Ripplepay source code. In order for the company to grow and keep inovating they went through multiple rounds of funding including Seed, Angel and series A,B and C to raise $293.9M.

**What is RippleNet**

RippleNet is a decentralized global network that enables financial institutions, payment providers, digital asset exchanges to send money globlly in real-time at a reduced cost. As of now Banks use the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) to process international transactions. In order to send money internationally you had to go through the bank and send money through SWIFT which had high fees and would take multiple days to clear. RippleNet set out to make this procces quicker and more efficient by harnessing the blockchain technology. XRP is the native currency used on the XRP Ledger that can settle transactions in 3-5 seconds. It works by converting the currency of a sender into XRP and sending it to the recipeint who can then convert XRP it into their own currency making it a convenient instrument in bridging differnet counrties quicky and efficiently. Aside from SWIFt other major companies in the global payment sector are Revolut, Transferwise and Stellar. Ripple has been able to gain a competitive advantage by being able to complete transactions in between three to five seconds. Even though swift has dramatically improved their proccessing speeds they still take 30 minutes for half GPI payments with almost every transaction being completed in less than 24 hours.
